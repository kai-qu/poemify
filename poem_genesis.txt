In the beginning 
God created 
the heavens and the earth. Now the 
earth was formless and 
empty, darkness was over 
the surface of the deep, and 
the Spirit of God was hovering over 
the waters. And God said, "Let there 
be 

light," and there 
was light. God 
saw 

that the 
light was good, and 
he separated the 
light from 
the darkness. God called 
the light "day," and the darkness he 
called 

"night." And there was evening, 

and there was 
morning--the first day. 
And God said, "Let there 

be an expanse between 
the waters 
to separate water from 
water." So 
God made the expanse and 

separated the water under 
the expanse from the 
water above it. And it 

was so. God called the 

expanse "sky." 
And there 
was 

evening, and there was morning--the second day. 
And 

God said, "Let the 
water under the sky be gathered 
to 

one place, and let 
dry ground appear." And 
it was so. 
God called the dry ground "land," 
and the 
gathered waters he 
called "seas." 
And God saw that it 

was good. Then God said, "Let the 
land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees 
on the 
land that bear 
fruit with seed in 
it, according 
to their various kinds." And it was 
so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing 
seed according to their 
kinds and 
trees bearing fruit with 
seed in it according to their kinds. 
And God 
saw that it was 
good. And 
there was evening, and there was morning--the 
third day. And God said, 

"Let there be lights 
in the 
expanse of the sky to separate the 
day from the night, and let them 
serve as 
signs to mark seasons and 

days and years, and let them be 
lights in the expanse of 

the sky to give light on the 
earth." And 
it 

was so.
